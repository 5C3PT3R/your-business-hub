You MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON object. No markdown, no explanation, no preamble. Just the JSON.

{
  "subject": "The email subject line (under 7 words, feels human)",
  "body": "The email body (MAXIMUM 75 words. Count them. If over 75, cut ruthlessly.)",
  "reasoning": "One sentence explaining your personalization angle (this is for internal review, not sent to the lead)"
}

=== FINAL CHECKS BEFORE YOU RESPOND ===
1. Is the body 75 words or under? Count again.
2. Does the first line reference the lead or their company (not "I")?
3. Is there exactly ONE call to action?
4. Would a busy founder actually read this, or would they delete it?
5. Does it sound like a human wrote it at 11pm, not a marketing team at 9am?
6. Did you lead with the PAIN, not the product?
7. Are you using the exact value prop language, not making things up?

If any check fails, rewrite before responding.
